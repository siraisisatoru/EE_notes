# Introdution
Hello world! This section is the collection of the projects that I developed in my year 2 major course.

We used the Microchip 18F520 IC develop board to develop games throughout the course.

We are allows to develop games or preset topics. My firend and I designed two games. However I handles the major or coding part.

Since the code may include some personal infomations, modifications will need to be made and thus will be uploaded later.
